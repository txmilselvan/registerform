# registerform
# Define functionalities: user registration, secure login, form validation, and storage.
# Identify user and stakeholder needs (e.g., admins needing to view user lists).
# Document non-functional requirements such as security, responsiveness, and usability.
# This phase ensures clarity and alignment before development begins 
# Model the data structure with ER diagrams (e.g., a User entity containing name, email, password hash).
# Normalize data (to 3NF) to prevent redundancy and ensure consistency.
# Define constraints: primary keys, unique emails, and data types.
# Backend: Python (Flask or Django) for routing, validation, database interactions.
# Database: SQL-based (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) for reliable storage.
# Frontend: HTML5 + Bootstrap for responsive, user-friendly forms.
# Consider using MVC architecture to clearly separate data (Model), presentation (View), and control logic (Controller)
# Conduct unit testing for backend componentsâ€”validation logic, hashing functions, SQL operations.
# Perform integration tests: form submissions through to database entries and login flow.
# Test frontend across devices to confirm responsiveness and accessibility.
# Security tests: verify SQL injection resistance, password storage safety, rate-limiting for brute-force protection
